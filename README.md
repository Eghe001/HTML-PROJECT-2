Created a webpage with a title that reflects the name of the restaurant (e.g., "Delicious Bites Menu").
Included a heading for each section of the menu: Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts.
Under each heading, i listed three items with their names and brief descriptions.
Used an unordered list for each section of the menu.
Add a link at the bottom of the page leading to a contact page using a placeholder link.
